This file should give an overview of what kind of features we want to have for
the project (scripts, database entries, ...) and which ones are already
implemented. It is divided into the different phases of the project:

Phase 1
=======
- analyse host supercells (DONE)

Phase 2
=======
- script to visualize convergence behaviour of relaxations (DONE)
- script to analyse failed calculations (TBD)
- excited state calculations (TBD)
- script to automatically submit the correct charge calculations (TBD)
- analysis of 1D model (IN PROGRESS)
- mapping script for local symmetry analysis (IN PROGRESS)
- 1D displacement amplitude, choose automatically (TBD)

Phase 3
=======
TBD

Phase 4
=======
TBD
